# Quantum-Classical-Divide-and-Conquer-Maximum-Independent-Set-Solver

Readme is still WIP

Requirement:
1. DWave access
2. QuEra access through Amazon Braket
3. Local copy of KaHIP
4. Local copy of KaMIS
5. Local copy of Luby's Algorithm

Features:
1. Sovle weighted and unweighted MIS problems through divide-and-conquer on DWave quantum annealers by recursively finding vertex separators
2. Sovle unweighted MIS problems through divide-and-conquer on QuEra quantum computers on King's graphs with holes
